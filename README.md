# HR Analytics: Employee Attrition Prediction Using Python and Power BI

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

This project, developed under **Elevate Labs**, aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques and visualize key patterns through interactive dashboards in Power BI. The goal is to identify employees at risk of leaving and uncover the underlying reasons behind attrition, enabling HR teams to implement effective retention strategies.

## 📊 Data Collection & Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset used contains detailed employee information such as:

- Age
- Job Role
- Department
- Income
- Years at Company
- Overtime
- Satisfaction Scores and more

Key EDA activities performed:

- 📌 Attrition Class Distribution  
- 📌 Numeric Feature Distribution (e.g., Age, Monthly Income, etc.)  
- 📌 Correlation Heatmap  
- 📌 Feature Importance (Random Forest)  
- 📌 SHAP Analysis for interpretability  
- 📌 Interactive Power BI Dashboard to analyze job role, gender, distance from home, and more

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

The following classification models were trained and evaluated:

- Random Forest  
- XGBoost   

🏆 **Random Forest** performed the best with strong accuracy and interpretability.

## ⚙️ Model Evaluation Techniques

To validate performance, we used:

- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC-AUC Curve  
- SHAP Summary Plot  
- Accuracy Score & Classification Report  
- K-Fold Cross Validation  
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling) for class balancing  
- Feature Scaling using StandardScaler

## 🔧 Tech Stack

**Languages & Libraries:**

- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- seaborn, matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  
- imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)  
- SHAP  

**Visualization & Dashboarding:**

- Power BI  
- Python-based graphs (ROC, Confusion Matrix, SHAP, etc.)
